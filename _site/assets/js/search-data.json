The most straightforward way to embed content without technical know-how is through the use of iframes. Knightlab projects are a particularly great option for this approach. | Juxtapose lets you show comparison images overlaid on each other (eg. a before and after shot). | . | Timeline.js is designed to give you a quick narrative timeline of events. | . | StoryMap.js lets you represent a sequence of events on a map. | . All of these tools can be inserted into your twine project directly using iframes in the text field of a path element. Iframes are generally less secure than other ways of including information but this is less of an issue with static websites. Note that iframes reliant on external services are also breakable. ",

Clearing sessions and cookies in a browser may also clear the storage of Twine 2. Using a different browser also means accessing different local storage.” . Always save your work when using the Online editor, especially clearing your cache. Desktop - “When used as a desktop application, Twine 2 stores its files under the current user’s files. The current collection of Stories can be accessed through the View -&gt; Show Story Library menu option.” . This means that files are stored wherever you normally save your files (eg. Documents if that’s your default folder for files). Twine will create a new folder called “Twine” in that default location (eg. Documents) and you will be able to find saved .html files of your Twine stories in a sub-folder called “Stories”. ",
